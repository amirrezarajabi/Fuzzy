# Fuzzy Logic
Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth value of variables may be any real number between `0` and `1`. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false.

Lotfi Aliasker Zadeh is best known as the founder of fuzzy mathematics, fuzzy set theory, fuzzy logic, Z numbers and Z-transform.

He was a mathematician, computer scientist, electrical engineer, artificial intelligence researcher, and professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.

## Projects
*   ### [Edge Detection](./Edge-Detection/)
    *   I use fuzzy logic to create an edge detector 
    *   [Results](./Edge-Detection/README.md)
*   ### [Fuzzy CMean](./Fuzzy-CMean/)
    *   Fuzzy clustering (also referred to as soft clustering or soft k-means) is a form of clustering in which each data point can belong to more than one cluster.
    *   [Results](./Fuzzy-CMean/README.md)
*   ### [Inverted Pendulum](./Inverted_Pendulum/)
    *   An inverted pendulum is a pendulum that has its center of mass above its pivot point. It is unstable and without additional help will fall over. I use fuzzy logic to stabilize it.
    *   [Results](./Inverted_Pendulum/README.md)
